            My name is Gursimran Kaur, but I go by Sim. I am a Computer Science major at Stony Brook University in Long
            Island, NY. I was originally an engineering major and after taking a programming class, I decided to make the 
            switch to computer science. Ironic thing is I was far from tech savy and knew nothing about tech, but I really
            liked coding. Throughout my entire highschool career, I refused to take computer science courses because I thought 
            it was a bunch of numbers and letters on the screen. Come to find out, it was the one subject that combined all of my passions.
        </p> 
        <p class= "bg-warning-subtle p-3">
            Besides programming some of my hobbies are art, badminton, working out, reading and dancing.
            I've always been a lover of the arts, culture, and learning new languages. Programming really puts all of that into one.
            So, learning new programming languages in South Africa is a literal dream. Plus, it's a nice getaway from my huge family.
            Love them, but I have 0 productivity because when my 3 siblings are around, we're all loud and chaotic at all hours.
